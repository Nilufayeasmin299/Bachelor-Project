# Bachelor-Project
Present a systematic framework based on NLP that is capable of extracting meaningful information from COVID-19 related comments on Twitter. Labeling the dataset into three groups based on the sentiment values, namely pos-itive, negative, and neutral, to train some popular deep learning algorithms to predict the user concern label on COVID-19. Before training, I used various word embedding schemes, such as the word to vector (Word2Vec) and global vectors for word representation (GloVe) versions, with three sets of dimensions (100, 200, and 300) for rep-resenting the text to numeric vectors for DL approaches.
